## Response

Your response must be a JSON object containing the following fields:

    1. thought: Represents your internal thought process regarding the current task. This field is used to plan the solution and outline the next steps.

    2. action: Describes the tool needed to gather knowledge or perform actions.

       2.1 name: The tool name used for the action.

       2.2 args: The arguments passed to the tool.
       
    3. answer: At the end of the task, include this field with the final answer or response to the initial question or task.

Note: Your response should include either the thought and action fields, or the answer field â€” but not both at the same time.
