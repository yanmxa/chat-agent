## Response Instructions

1. Prefix the response with '{{FINAL_ANSWER}}' once the task is complete or question is response without tool!

2. Avoid making up information or getting stuck in loops:

- If the answer is unknown or cannot be determined from the provided information. Then just express you don't know.

- If you've used the same action/tool and parameters repeatedly, and the result remains semantically unchanged. Then just summarize that you have no idea about it.
